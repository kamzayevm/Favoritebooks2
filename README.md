My project is about displaying my favorite books. Users can view a list of books, select any 
book to see more details, and navigate back with a back button. I've also added a favorites button,
allowing users to mark books as favorites. When clicked, the app can filter and display only the
favorite books. All functionalities are fully implemented for a smooth user experience.
